# SAF-Toolkit
## Sustainability Assessment Framework (SAF) Toolkit
This reporitory contains the material of SAF-Tooolkit, a set of instruments to design the network of sustainability-quality concerns at the software architecture level, and define and operationalize them.

The SAF-Toolkit was developed at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. It entails the following instruments:
1. [**Decision Map (DM)**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2024-02]%20DM%20Library%20[features+concerns].xml) visual notation (library to be used in the [Diagrams.net tool](https://www.diagrams.net)): diagram framing and illustrating the (software architecture) sustainability-relevant design- and quality concerns and their related dependencies;
2. [**Checklist**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2024-02]%20Checklist.pdf): reflective questions to help defining the elements of a DM; this include the [**Decision Graph**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2022-04]%20DecisionGraph.pdf), which helps the classification of concerns in the sustainability dimensions and level of impact;
3. [**Dependency Matrix'es (DMatrix) template**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2024-02]%20_template_DMatrix.xlsx): helps completing and complementing the own DM for the most relevant sustainability dimensions; identifying missing sustainability-quality concerns; and identifying missing dependencies. It includes: (i) instructions for use and extension; DMatrix of dependencies between SQ concerns (ii) in the Technical-Social dimensions; (iii) in the Technical-Environmental dimensions; and (iv) in the Technical-Economic dimensions (version 2022-04);
4. [**Sustainability-Quality (SQ) Model template**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2024-02]%20_template_SQ-Model.xlsx): for each SQ concern (aka attribute aka characteristic), it captures consolidated definitions and the metrics/KPIs to operationalize them. It includes: (i) the template to define the own SQ model; and (ii) the SQ Model (version 1.1 dated 2022-04) created from past projects and the ISO/IEC 25010-2011 standard.
5. [**Key Performance Indicator (KPI) template**](./SAF%20Toolkit%20[2024-02]/[2024-02]%20_template_KPI%20Model%20w_%20Checklist.xlsx): to establish and define the metrics and measures for the QAs within the SQ Model systematically, we aim to incorporate a KPI Model. It includes: (i) the KPI model as template for crafting own KPIs derived from the SQ model; and (ii) a practical KPI checklist for evaluating their soundness.

## SAF Toolkit Overview
High-level overview of all involved instruments and their relation. Instruments inside the dashed-blue rectangle are available in its current version; instruments outside are plan of our future vision and have yet to be integrated.
